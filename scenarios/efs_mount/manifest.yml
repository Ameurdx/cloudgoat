        has access to parts of ecs. Abusing these privcialges the attacker can backdoor an exsiting task defentiaon to
        privaages esscate into the instance role of the container. Using these the attacker can the new privcalges to modifiy the tags on the admin ec2.
        Once the tags are modngied they are able to use ssm:StartSessio to access the ec2. Once in the Admin ec2 the attacker can scan for ef2 and mount it to win.
